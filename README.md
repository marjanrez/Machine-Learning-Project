# Machine-Learning-Project

Banking Fraud has been an ever-growing issue with huge consequences to banks and customers, in terms of financial losses, trust and credibility.
An effective fraud detection system should be able to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and efficiency.
A major challenge in applying ML to fraud detection is presence of highly imbalanced data sets. In many available datasets, majority of transactions are genuine with an extremely small percentage of fraudulent ones. Designing an accurate and efficient fraud detection system that is low on false positives but detects fraudulent activity effectively is a significant challenge.
In our project, we apply multiple binary classification approaches such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest and Voting Classifier to solve this problem on a labeled dataset that consists of payment transactions. our machine learning models collect information, analyzes the data gathered and extracts the required features.
Our goal is to build binary classifiers which are able to separate fraud transactions from non-fraud transactions. We compare the effectiveness of these approaches in detecting fraud transactions.
